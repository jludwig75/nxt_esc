# nxt_esc
This project is for an ESC for connecting an RC receiver and an ordinary RC battery to Lego Mindstorms NXT motors. I took ideas from Wayne and Layne's Bricktronics shield. I am not an electrical engineer, so if you like this idea and know how to improve it, pleas let me know.

Materials
- Arduino Pro Mini
- L293A motor driver
- 100 uF capacitor
- 0.1 uF capacitor
- 47 uF capacitor
- 9V Voltage vregulator
- SPDT slider switch
- 2 trim pots
- 2 100k ohm resistors
- 2 NXT jacks from Wayne and Layne
